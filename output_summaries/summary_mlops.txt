MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a discipline that combines machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to deploy and maintain machine learning systems at scale. It involves creating an automated pipeline for the entire ML lifecycle, from data preparation to deployment and continuous improvement. MLOps aims to bring agility and reliability to ML development, just like DevOps did for software development. Key aspects of MLOps include automation, version control, continuous integration and delivery, monitoring and logging, and collaboration between teams. By adopting MLOps practices, organizations can accelerate the deployment of ML solutions, improve their reliability, and unlock the true value of artificial intelligence.
